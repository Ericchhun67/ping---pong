# ping---pong
This project is a classic Pong clone built with Python and Pygame. Two players can face off by controlling paddles on opposite sides of the screen, bouncing the ball back and forth while trying to score points. The game includes simple but effective mechanics: smooth paddle movement, ball physics, collision detection, and a scoreboard.

The project is organized into modular files (paddle.py, ball.py, game_manager.py, etc.) to keep the code clean and maintainable. It’s designed as a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the fundamentals of game development in Python—perfect for anyone learning how to structure games with Pygame.
