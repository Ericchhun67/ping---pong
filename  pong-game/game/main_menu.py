# the starting screen of your Pong game, giving players a place to begin before 
# the action starts. It will handle drawing the title, instructions, and menu 
# options like “Start Game,” “Quit,” or even “Settings” if you expand later.
# This file manages keyboard input so players can navigate the menu 
# (for example, pressing Enter to start the game). It also allows you to 
# separate menu logic from the main game loop, which keeps the code clean 
# and organized. In a beginner setup, the menu can just be a simple screen 
# with text, but you can later add background images, sound effects, or 
# animations to make it feel more polished.
